       "\"Who We Are BlackThorn Therapeutics is a computational sciences company with capabilities to develop proprietary therapeutics focused on neurobehavioral disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and autism. We have pioneered the development of a computational psychiatry platform to advance our robust pipeline of novel therapeutics. We leverage data-driven approaches to solve the patient selection problem to create treatments that improve patient outcomes.  The Position Help us create the next-gen AI technologies to make better decisions in end-to-end drug development, clinical trials, and deployment lifecycle. A successful candidate will develop and implement AI models and algorithms on large-scale, multimodal neuroimaging, physiological, and clinical datasets to deepen our understanding of neurobehavioral disorders and their treatment. You will work with scientists, clinical researchers, and software developers to implement solutions to support our data-driven approaches to improving the lives of people with neurobehavioral disorders. At the same time, you will be rolling up your sleeves working on tactical tasks that will keep your coding and troubleshooting skills sharp. We value proactive thinkers and doers who identify opportunities for technology innovation in digital health.  Who You Are You have a PhD degree specialized in a topic related to computational neuroscience, statistics, or applied machine learning. You should have a proven record of publishing peer-reviewed papers in scientific journals and conferences. You have extensive experience working with large-scale neuroimaging datasets including task-based and resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, and DWI. You have ample experience with neuroimaging processing software such as AFNI, FSL, and Freesurfer. You are proficient in Python and machine learning toolboxes such as scikit-learn and pandas. Prior experience with processing signal modalities such as EEG, eye-tracking, and speech signal is a strong plus. Experience bringing machine learning projects to industrial production is also a plus. Your excellent communication skills help you explain complex models and solutions to non-technical peers.'\""
